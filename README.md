This Collective Knowledge repository contains various mathematical libraries 
in the [portable and customizable CK format](http://github.com/ctuning/ck) 
with JSON API and JSON meta information to be used 
in portable, customizable and reproducible [CK research workflows](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows).

Feel free to provide extra packages to [enable open and reproducible R&D](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Enabling-open-science).
